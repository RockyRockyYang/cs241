Your Lincoln Hall exam seat is row 'L' and seat 'Center-105'. Don't panic - you can look this up when you get there if you wish. Row numbers start from the front. Seat numbers count from the South wall and are divided into 3 areas (South, Center North). From the back of the room the South wall is on your left. If you arrive after the exam has started we may ask you to sit at the front of the room instead.
